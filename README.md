Download files from remote servers and effortlessly manage them.

You have large amounts of large files on a remote server (e.g. a seedbox) and you want to download and stage them nicely.  Dakait lets you do that.

You create tags (pretty looking names for local directories) and tag your remote file on a web-interface.  Dakait takes care of downloading and staging them for you.

Current Release
---
Current release version is `0.1.3`.  It will do what its supposed to do, but it has a long way to go.

How to run
---

You need a configuration file to run Dakait.  Modify and rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`. This file must reside in the working directory (path where you run this program from).

Once you have the jar file, make sure your server has a recent enough version of java.  You can start the server by running the following command

    java -jar dakait-0.1.3-standalone.jar
    
This will start a server and bind to port `3000`.  Now point your browser to `http://server-address:3000/`

What are tags?
---

Tags are an easy way of classifying a file.  

Lets say you create a tag called `Ubuntu Image` and assign it a target `images/ubuntu`.  While browsing the remote server through Dakait's web-interface, whenever you tag a file or a directory with `Ubuntu Image` Dakait will start downlaoding the tagged file/directory to your `<local-base-path>/images/ubuntu` Directory.  Note that reapplying a tag just initiates a new download, this will change in a future release when Dakait becomes smart enough to detect this.

Why?

I really wanted to learn clojure and really really needed a tool like this.
